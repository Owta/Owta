## Hey there, i'm Owta.

  You may know me as Jason, or Lily if you know me well enough.
 
 I make stupid shit and sometimes publish it here.
  Stupid shit being a scuffed AutoHotKey program to hook all keystrokes to itself for cleaning your laptop keyboard while it's running
  
 I'm currently learning C++, JS, HTML and CSS, mostly for web app development, but also just so I can have a functional homepage that *isn't* Firefox's blank page.
